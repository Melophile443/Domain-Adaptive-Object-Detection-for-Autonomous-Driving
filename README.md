Domain Adaptive Object Detection for  Autonomous Driving.

The first phase involves fog detection, where a specialized convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to identify fog density in input images from vehicle sensors. 
In the second phase, image enhancement techniques and deep learning algorithms are applied to enhance features in foggy images, improving visibility of crucial objects like vehicles and pedestrians. The final phase integrates a modified object detection model with path planning algorithms, enabling the system to detect objects and navigate safely even in reduced visibility conditions.
 To optimize real-time performance, the system employs latency reduction strategies such as model quantization and hardware acceleration.
